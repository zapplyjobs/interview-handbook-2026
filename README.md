# <p align="center">Interview Handbook 2026</p>

<p align="center">Roughly speaking, we can divide interview questions into three main categories: behavioral questions, technical questions, and curveballs. 
  
<p align="center">🤝 The goal of <i>behavioral questions</i> is to gauge your skills, abilities, and personality. They want to see how your past behavior reflects and predicts your future behavior. Ultimately, it’s about determining a cultural fit.</p>
  
<p align="center">🛠️ <i>Techncial questions</i> are used to judge your technical knowledge and expertise. Do you have the necessary foundation to solve highly complex problems on the spot or not?</p>
  
<p align="center">🎲 And <i>curveballs</i> are surprise questions through which the company wants to see how you react to a sudden situation.</p>

<p align="center">Let’s go over some common behavioral, technical, and curveball questions you can expect in an interview.</p>

> [!NOTE]
> The questions we’re sharing are only a sample. Interviewers can go off script and ask vastly different questions. It shouldn’t be taken as a hard and fast rule that you’ll always be asked these questions.

> [!TIP]
> While you don't need to memorize answers, have a sense of what experiences you would share and how to describe them to the interviewer. You'll want your examples to be both clear and succinct.

## Behavioral Questions

Interviewers ask behavioral questions to know about your past work and see if you have the skills needed for the job. They assume that your behavior in the past reflects how you will behave in the future. 

To answer these questions, use the CAR (challenge, action, result) approach. When describing a past accomplishment, provide a challenge you were facing, the action you took to solve it, and the end result you achieved. 

The following behavioral questions may be asked to discern your personality and soft skills, and whether they align with the company’s values:

---

### Teamwork

For questions like these, you want a story that illustrates your ability to work with others under challenging circumstances. Think team conflict, difficult project constraints, or clashing personalities.

- Have you handled a difficult situation with a co-worker? How?
- What do you do if you disagree with a co-worker?
- Share an example of how you were able to motivate employees or co-workers.
- Have you handled a difficult situation with a supervisor? How?
- Have you handled a difficult situation with another department? How?
- What do you do if you disagree with your boss?

Mention an experience that showcases your ability to work in a team. You can describe a time when you voluntarily helped a fellow employee. Or an academic project that you undertook and completed successfully as a team. Make sure you don't mention other team members in a negative connotation.

---

#### 📌 Example 1: Give an example of how you've worked on a team.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "One of my projects was really time-intensive. Even though me and my peers had divided tasks equally, one of the team members was facing an issue and her task was delayed. I voluntarily helped her solve the problem and we were able to submit the project in time."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "My teammates were struggling so I carried the project."

---

### Client-Facing Skills

If the role you're interviewing for works with clients, definitely be ready for one of these. Find an example of a time where you successfully represented your company or team and delivered excellent client service.

- Have you handled a difficult situation with a client or vendor? How?
- Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client's expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
- Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.
- Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
- When you're working with a large number of customers, it's tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers' needs?

You can mention a time when you resolved a difficult situation with a client and were able to retain the customer. You can also mention a time when a client was exceptionally satisfied with your service. After describing a situation, you can associate it with your work philosophy with respect to customer service.

---

#### 📌 Example 2: Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "Based on my customer service, one of my clients voluntarily returned and repaid for a large purchase after an internal system discrepancy caused an incomplete transaction."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I made a good impression on all of my clients."

---

### Ability to Adapt

Think of a recent work crisis you successfully navigated. Even if your navigation didn't feel successful at the time, find a lesson or silver lining you took from the situation.

- Give an example of an occasion when you used logic to solve a problem.
- How do you handle a challenge?
- Have you ever made a mistake? How did you handle it?
- Did you ever make a risky decision? Why? How did you handle it?
- What do you do when your schedule is interrupted? Give an example of how you handle it.

Talk about a work task or an academic project that was substantially stressful for you. It may be due to significant workload, a strict deadline, or other responsibilities. You can describe a situation where you had to complete a task and address personal duties while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

---

#### 📌 Example 3: Tell me about how you worked effectively under pressure.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "While pursuing my Bachelor's degree, I had to work on my final year project while taking care of my newborn child. Managing both tasks simultaneously was especially stressful however, both my grades and my expertise in economics prove my persistence."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I try not be under pressure when undertaking a task."

These questions also test your ability to handle sudden, changing, or unfortunate scenarios. Maybe you handled an escalating customer conflict, streamlined change management processes, or mitigated an unexpected technical problem.

---

#### 📌 Example 4: Describe a stressful situation and how you handled it.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "One of the clients was quite unsatisfied with her purchase and came back to the store to return the item. To avoid a scene, I reacted quickly and used a consultative approach to understand her issue and refund her purchase. Ultimately, she purchased an alternative product based on the way I handled the situation."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I don't get stressed while undertaking a task."

---

#### 📌 Example 5: Do you prefer to work alone or with other people?

There's no one answer to this question and being honest is important here. Think of the projects you've worked on in the past. Were you better at working in a group or independently? Maybe you equally excelled in both cases. Either way, you should be able to prove your answer by giving an example of your past experiences. You should also make sure that your answer aligns with the job requirements. For instance, always preferring independent work while applying for a team-oriented job might backfire. Similarly, you shouldn't convey that you're only a team player in an interview for a job that requires individual effort. In any case, the key is to be unbiased towards both options. Even if you prefer one of the two choices, mention that you value the other approach as well.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "I am very comfortable working on a team, but I can also work independently, as well."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I can't concentrate with other people around me."

---

#### 📌 Example 6: What sort of work environment do you prefer?

The rules to answer this kind of question are quite similar to the ones that work for "Do you prefer to work alone or with other people?" Be honest but unbiased and make sure that your answer aligns with the company's work environment. Moreover, portray yourself as someone who is flexible and adaptable to most kind of environments. However, if there are certain environments that you absolutely cannot work in, say you face difficulty handling them without sounding too biased.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "I can be flexible when it comes to my work environment. From your website, it looks like the environment in the engineering department here at RRS, Inc., is fast-paced and structured to expand production. I enjoy working in an area experiencing rapid growth and I think this kind of environment is conducive to new ideas and applications."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I absolutely cannot work in a fast-paced environment."

---

#### 📌 Example 7: Describe a recent/important project you worked on.

By answering this question, you can showcase how you handle difficult situations, resolve challenges, and use your work ethic to handle stress. When preparing for this question, make a list of all the major projects you undertook in your career. Select the ones that are relevant to the job requirements and think about your responsibilities based on the CAR (challenge, action, result) approach. Mention the challenge you were facing, the actions you took to tackle them, and the end result you achieved.

While mentioning a project, be concise and specific, and explain your role and accomplishments clearly without sounding arrogant. You shouldn't mention what your team members did and you shouldn't blame them either. Finally, discuss what the project taught you in a positive light instead of focusing on the negatives or things you disliked about the project.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "My company did not have a proper way of maintaining client documents. There were paper files and records all over the place. After identifying this issue, I hired a database specialist and collaborated with him to store all the client information in a single, consolidated database. Moreover, I transitioned company data onto a cloud-based platform. By doing so, I improved the accuracy, integrity, and accessibility of data."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I worked on a project to design a web application. I worked on the frontend and my team member worked on the backend. I used HTML and CSS to create the frontend whereas he was using PHP. He was lagging behind so I helped him finish the backend to finish the project in time."

---

### Time Management Skills

Talk about a time you juggled multiple responsibilities, organized it all (perfectly), and completed everything before the deadline.

- Did you ever postpone making a decision? Why?
- When you worked on multiple projects how did you prioritize?
- Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?
- Tell me about a time you set a goal for yourself. How did you go about ensuring that you would meet your objective?
- Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

Describe a time when you completed a task perfectly within the expected deadline. You can also mention a situation where you had to juggle multiple tasks at once. Even if the deadline for a task wasn't strict, you can talk about a scenario when you completed that task to optimize your time for other duties.

---

#### 📌 Example 8: How did you handle meeting a tight deadline?

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "One of my recent projects was quite substantial with a really strict deadline. However, I made it digestible for myself by dividing it into tasks with dedicated deadlines using Excel and a time tracking tool."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I complete all tasks with perfection even if it takes more time."

---

### Communication Skills

You probably won't have any trouble thinking of a story for communication questions, since it's not only part of most jobs; it's part of everyday life. However, the thing to remember here is to also talk about your thought process or preparation.

- Describe a decision you made that was unpopular and how you handled implementing it.
- Have you ever dealt with company policy you weren't in agreement with? How?
- Have you had to convince a team to work on a project they weren't thrilled about? How?
- Tell me about a successful presentation you gave and why you think it was a hit.
- Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?
- Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.

Give examples where you got your point across effectively, listened carefully, or used your negotiation skills to resolve a conflict or facilitate a change. You can also showcase your presentation and written communication abilities by answering this question.

---

#### 📌 Example 9: Do you listen? Give an example of when you did or when you didn't listen.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "As a sales rep, I always listen to my clients' needs before suggesting a product. As an example, one of my clients conveyed his requirements to me in detail but didn't purchase anything. He returned a week later and was pleasantly surprised that I remembered all of his requirements."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I only listen to myself." OR "I listen to and act on every coworkers' suggestion."

---

### Motivation and Values

A lot of seemingly random interview questions are actually ways to learn more about what motivates you. Your response would ideally address this directly even if the question wasn't explicit about it.

- Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.
- Give an example of a goal you didn't meet and how you handled it.
- Have you been in a situation where you didn't have enough work to do?
- Have you gone above and beyond the call of duty? If so, how?
- Give an example of how you set goals and achieve them.
- Did you ever not meet your goals? Why?

These questions are used to figure out your values and whether they align with the company's vision or not. Remain honest while mentioning your beliefs as you might find a workplace that perfectly aligns with your values. However, don't emphasize beliefs that have negative implications. Focus on your positive motivations and how they add value to the company. While keeping this in mind, make sure to describe a real-life example that proves the value you're mentioning. Otherwise, you might portray a sense of entitlement to the job.

---

#### 📌 Example 10: Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "In my recent internship, I set a personal goal to not only accomplish my set objectives for my internship, but also to develop proficiency in a new tool or technology. My objectives for my internship were both completed and I was also able to develop proficiency in Java, which I had previously only used in my classes at school."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I've been a gamer since I was a kid and one of my goals was to achieve one of the top ten scores in Minecraft. This past year I was able to score #10 on the global list."

---

#### 📌 Example 11: Tell me about yourself.

This question is the perfect opportunity to sell yourself in an interview. You should avoid talking about your personal story or even explain your work experience in detail. Rather, you need to mention a few accomplishments that help you pitch the employer on why you're the right person for the job.

A good practice is to follow the present-past-future approach. First, talk about the state of your career right now. Then, briefly mention relevant skills you've gained from past experiences. Finally, describe your future aspirations and how they align with this particular opportunity.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "Well, I'm currently an account executive at Smith, where I handle our top performing client. Before that, I worked at an agency where I was on three different major national healthcare brands. And while I really enjoyed the work that I did, I'd love the chance to dig in much deeper with one specific healthcare company, which is why I'm so excited about this opportunity with Metro Health Center."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I have 2 kids so my daily routine mostly revolves around them." OR "I'm looking for a company that will help me grow." OR "I like coffee and watching football."

---

#### 📌 Example 12: Can you tell me a little more about your current/most recent job?

This question is really a close-ended version of "Tell me about yourself." It is essential to keep the answer concise and avoid unnecessary details. To do so, you should primarily focus on your key accomplishments rather than your job duties. Talk about the ways you helped the company by fulfilling your responsibilities instead of just listing them. You should only talk about accomplishments that relate to the job and make the connection between them and the job requirements as clear as possible.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "My day-to-day involves looking at buying data, which has a big impact on how our sales team approaches conversations with potential clients."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "My day-to-day involves looking at buying data. I look at it, analyze it, and compile it before sending it to the higher-ups."

---

#### 📌 Example 13: Can you describe a typical day at work in your last job?

This question is closely related to "Can you tell me a little more about your current/most recent job?" but has a subtle difference. Instead of primarily talking about your accomplishments, you need to mention your responsibilities. However, avoid describing a long list of duties and focus on the major responsibilities that align with the job you're applying for. Also mention how you were able to meet those duties. Tell the employer that you're successfully completing the job.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing the facility, as well as overseeing a staff of seven individuals. I also provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I was responsible for various administrative duties, including answering phones, drafting documents and emails, filing and greeting customers. I was also in charge of maintaining databases, resolving issues, and fixing bugs."

---

#### 📌 Example 14: Tell me again what interests you about this job and what skills you plan to bring to it.

To prepare for questions that are aimed at identifying your skills, read through the job listing and make a list of your skills that match the requirements in the job posting. Then, circle strengths that make you unique and tailor your answer to show that you are well suited for the job because of those strengths. You should show that the job interests you because it requires the unique skills you excel at and thus, you can provide value to the company.

Avoid generic answers that emphasize the job perks or how the job might benefit you. Instead, explain how your skills can relate to and enhance the company's mission.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "I am interested in this job as a programmer because I am extremely interested in, and skilled at, learning and excelling at new technologies. I have already learned and mastered programs and languages ranging from Python to Java, and I look forward to mastering more programs as they're developed. I am also interested in creative problem solving, a skill I developed when working as an analyst for the past ten years."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I want a job that will help me build my career." OR "The salary package is really good."

---

#### 📌 Example 15: Why did you leave your recent job?

While an honest answer to this question is important, you should avoid potential mistakes. The general rule here is that you should always be leaving to move toward a better opportunity. However, don't make it sound like money or perks are the only things you care about. Shape it based on your career goals and what you want your future work life to look like. However, don't sound impulsive, vague, or scattered in terms of what you want in your career. You should be able to prove that you have a clear goal and are taking steps to pursue it.

Moreover, you should never portray your position as fleeing from a bad opportunity. This means that you should not badmouth your previous employer or the company you worked at. Recruiters might get the impression that you might blame others again if there's a disagreement.

In any case, it's important to step up and take responsibility while conveying that you have a clear vision of your future career goals.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "I had been with the organization for a number of years and wanted to experience a new environment to continue growing." OR "I reevaluated my career goals and decided a change was needed."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "The salary wasn't good enough." OR "My boss didn't care about his staff's personal lives."

---

#### 📌 Example 16: What would you consider an acceptable salary for this position?

There are multiple ways to answer this question, but each of them requires some research. You should provide not only a number you're comfortable with but the appropriate compensation for the job based on real data. Indeed, Payscale, Glassdoor, and Salary are some resources you can use to find out the appropriate salaries for jobs in your respective area.

Providing a specific number may hinder your chances at getting a good compensation package or even the job. If your salary expectation is too high, the recruiters might reject you. If it's too low, you might lose a better offer. You can use some techniques to avoid these situations. Firstly, you can offer a salary range. Keep in mind, however, that the employer might opt for the lower end of the range. So, make sure your target is as close to the bottom as possible. Secondly, you can include other negotiation options. If you think your salary target is higher than what the job might be offering, you can request the negotiation of additional benefits. Finally, if you're still unsure about the specifics of job duties and salary expectations, you can deflect the question for later in the interview. However, you might still need to answer the question eventually.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "After researching the market, I am seeking a position that pays between $75,000 and $80,000 annually." OR "I am seeking a position that pays between $75,000 and $80,000 annually but I am open to negotiate salary depending on benefits, bonuses, equity, stock options, and other opportunities." OR "Before I answer, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a better idea of what the position entails. That way, I can provide a more realistic expectation."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I want more than what I'm getting paid in my current job." OR "Whatever you deem fit." OR "I'd like to skip that question."

---

#### 📌 Example 17: If you got the job, what would you do in your first year to establish yourself?

A way more common alternative to this question is, "What would you accomplish in your first 30/60/90 days on the job?" To answer these questions, you'll need to research the company, similar job listings, and employee resumes to know what the industry requires from new hires.

Set realistic goals and don't make yourself seem too overconfident or passive. Unless the job specifically calls for it, avoid focusing on overhauling the current work environment or procedures. Instead, show that you're eager to learn at the start, thoroughly understand and adhere to the company's mission, and finally contribute to the organization's mission. Whatever the case, give the impression that you have a clear sense of direction.

> [!TIP]
> **Good Answer:** "In addition to getting to know the team and getting fully up to speed with the role, there's a lot I want to accomplish during my first three months in the role of editor. During my first 30 days, I want to get a sense of our blog's editorial goals and use those to create a new blog design. After 60 days, I want our blog redesign launched and to have at least 50 contributors writing for the website. After 90 days, I want to switch the efforts from building the team to tracking growth, and I'm hoping that we can have 100,000 unique visitors by then through utilizing our marketing channels and those of our contributors."

> [!WARNING]
> **Bad Answer:** "I guess I'll have to wait and see." OR "I'll transform and revamp company processes." OR "I'll observe and learn new things."

In case you're unsure of the exact goals the company wants you to accomplish, you should have a generic backup answer ready similar to this one:

> [!TIP]
> "Within 30 days, I plan to get to know the people I'll be working with the most and to be comfortable with them. Within 60 days, I plan to have a solid understanding of the industry, the company and the competitive landscape so that I can hold my own in any conversation about the company. Within 90 days, I plan to meet the goals that have been set for me."

---

The best way to answer any behavioral question is with an anecdote. Given the fact that you're a fresh graduate, you can use examples from your academic or everyday life to answer some of the questions. For example, if you get asked, "How do you handle a challenge?" You can talk about a challenge you addressed during your studies or in your everyday life that was hindering you in some way. It's not necessary to always answer such questions with an example from your working experience.
